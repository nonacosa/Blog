# Hi I’m Nonacosa
My name is Radek and I’m the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

<!--more-->This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!

The theme includes:

-  **light/dark mode** , depending on your preferences

- great reading experience thanks to **[Inter font](https://rsms.me/inter/)** , made by[Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)

- nice code highlighting thanks to **[PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/)** 

So, there you have it… enjoy!
